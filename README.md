# BigDocker

This project aims to implement a big data architecture in a Docker image. This big data architecture should contain key components, including data source, data storage, batch processing, real-time message ingestion and streaming processing (c.f., https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/guide/architecture-styles/big-data). The above components should support some basic or typical use cases.
